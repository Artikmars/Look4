<p><strong>What is Look4?</strong></p>
<p>Look4 will help you exchange contacts with a person close to you (within a radius of up to 20 m), who also has this application installed. The main advantage is that the Internet is not needed for this, so you can easily exchange phones on the subway, airplane and in other hard-to-reach places.</p>
<p>To find each other, one person must turn on the &ldquo;Online&rdquo; mode -  then the phone can be found by others. In this case, you can hide the application. We will notify you when you receive a new contact request. The one who is looking for clicks the &ldquo;Search&rdquo; button. If successful, both will receive each other's phone numbers, which can be viewed in the &ldquo;Contacts&rdquo; section.&nbsp;</p>
